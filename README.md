SpreeSocial
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spree/spree_social.png)](https://travis-ci.org/spree/spree_social)


**NOTE: If you were contributing to the 0.70.x version of this extension, please make sure you are using the 0_70_stable branch, as this branch has recently been forced push to in order to release the 1.0.x extension rewrite.**

Core for all social media related functionality for Spree. 
The Spree Social gem handles authorization, account creation and association through social media sources such as Twitter and Facebook. 
This requires the edge source of [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree). 
This gem is beta at best and should be treated as such. 
Features and code base will change rapidly as this is under active development. 
Use with caution.

Setup for Production
--------------------
Add this extension to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "spree_social", :git => "git://github.com/spree/spree_social.git"
```

Then run:

```
bundle update
rails g spree_social:install
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Preference(optional): By default url will be '/users/auth/:provider'. If you wish to modify the url to: '/member/auth/:provider', '/profile/auth/:provider', or '/auth/:provider' then you can do this accordingly in your **config/initializers/spree.rb** file as described below -

```ruby
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = 'member' # for /member/auth/:provider
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = 'profile' # for /profile/auth/:provider
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = '' # for /auth/:provider
```

Spree Setup to Utilize OAuth Sources
------------------------------------

Login as an admin user and navigate to Configuration > Social Authentication Methods

Click on the New Authentication Method button to enter the key obtained from their respective source
(See below for instructions on setting up the various providers)

Multiple key entries can now be entered based on the rails environment. This allows for portability and the lack of need to check in your key to your repository. You also have the ability to enable and disable sources. These setting will be reflected on the client UI as well.

**You MUST restart your application after configuring or
updating an authentication method.**
