# Spree Social

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_social.svg?branch=2-4-stable)](https://travis-ci.org/spree-contrib/spree_social)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/spree-contrib/spree_social/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/spree-contrib/spree_social)

Core for all social media related functionality for Spree.
The Spree Social gem handles authorization, account creation and association through social media sources such as Twitter and Facebook.
This gem is beta at best and should be treated as such.
Features and code base will change rapidly as this is under active development.
Use with caution.

---

## Setup for Production

Add this extension to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'spree_social', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_social', branch: '2-4-stable'
```

Then run:
```sh
$ bundle && bundle exec rails g spree_social:install
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

Preference(optional): By default url will be '/users/auth/:provider'. If you wish to modify the url to: '/member/auth/:provider', '/profile/auth/:provider', or '/auth/:provider' then you can do this accordingly in your **config/initializers/spree.rb** file as described below -

```ruby
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = 'member' # for /member/auth/:provider
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = 'profile' # for /profile/auth/:provider
Spree::SocialConfig[:path_prefix] = '' # for /auth/:provider
```

## Spree Setup to Utilize OAuth Sources

Login as an admin user and navigate to Configuration > Social Authentication Methods

Click on the New Authentication Method button to enter the key obtained from their respective source, (See below for instructions on setting up the various providers).

Multiple key entries can now be entered based on the rails environment. This allows for portability and the lack of need to check in your key to your repository. You also have the ability to enable and disable sources. These setting will be reflected on the client UI as well.

Alternatively you can ship keys as environment variables and create these Authentication Method records on application boot via an initializer. Below is an example for facebook.

```ruby
# Ensure our environment is bootstrapped with a facebook connect app
if ActiveRecord::Base.connection.table_exists? 'spree_authentication_methods'
  Spree::AuthenticationMethod.where(environment: Rails.env, provider: 'facebook').first_or_create do |auth_method|
    auth_method.api_key = ENV['FACEBOOK_APP_ID']
    auth_method.api_secret = ENV['FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET']
    auth_method.active = true
  end
end
```

**You MUST restart your application after configuring or updating an authentication method.**

## Setup the Applications at the Respective Sources

OAuth Applications @ Facebook, Twitter and / or Github are supported out of the box but you will need to setup applications are each respective site as follows for public use and for development.

> All URLs must be in the form of domain.tld you may add a port as well for development

### Facebook

[Facebook / Developers / Apps][2]

1. Name the app what you will and agree to the terms.
2. Fill out the capcha
3. Under the Web Site tab
4. Site URL: http://your_computer.local:3000 for development / http://your-site.com for production
5. Site domain: your-computer.local / your-site.com respectively

### Twitter

[Twitter / Application Management / Create an application][3]

1. Name and Description must be filled in with something
2. Application Website: http://your_computer.local:3000 for development / http://your-site.com for production
3. Application Type: Browser
4. Callback URL: http://your_computer.local:3000 for development / http://your-site.com for production
5. Default Access Type: Read & Write
6. Save Application

### Github

[Github / Applications / Register a new OAuth application][4]

1. Name The Application
2. Main URL: http://your_computer.local:3000 for development / http://your-site.com for production
3. Callback URL: http://your_computer.local:3000 for development / http://your-site.com for production
4. Click Create

> This does not seem to be a listed Github item right now. To View and / or edit your applications goto [http://github.com/account/applications](http://github.com/account/applications)

### Amazon

[Amazon / App Console / Register a new OAuth application][10]

1. Register New Application
2. Name the Application, provide description and URL for Privacy Policy
3. Click Save
4. Add Your site under Web Settings > Allowed Return URLs (example: http://localhost:3000/users/auth/amazon/callback)

> The app console is available at [https://login.amazon.com/manageApps](https://login.amazon.com/manageApps)

### Other OAuth sources that are currently supported

* Google (OAuth)

## Adding other OAuth sources

It is easy to add any OAuth source, given there is an OmniAuth strategy gem for it (and if not, you can easily [write one by yourself](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Strategy-Contribution-Guide). For instance, if you want to add authorization via LinkedIn, the steps will be:

1. Add `gem "omniauth-linkedin"` to your Gemfile, run `bundle install`.
2. In an initializer file, e.g. `config/initializers/devise.rb`, add and init a new provider for SpreeSocial:

        SpreeSocial::OAUTH_PROVIDERS << ['LinkedIn', 'linkedin']
        SpreeSocial.init_provider('linkedin')

  **Optional**: If you want to skip the sign up phase where the user has to provide an email and a password, add a third parameter to the provider entry and the Spree user will be created directly using the email field in the [Auth Hash Schema](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema):

          SpreeSocial::OAUTH_PROVIDERS << ['LinkedIn', 'linkedin', 'true']
          SpreeSocial.init_provider('linkedin')

3. Activate your provider as usual (via initializer or admin interface).
4. Override `spree/users/social` view to render OAuth links in preferred way for a new one to be displayed. Or alternatively, include to your CSS a definition for `.icon-spree-linkedin-circled` and an embedded icon font for LinkedIn from [fontello.com](http://fontello.com/) (the way existing icons for Facebook, Twitter, etc are implemented). You can also override CSS classes for other providers, `.icon-spree-<provider>-circled`, to use different font icons or classic background images, without having to override views.
